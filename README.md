<img src="https://github.com/teamServiceNow7/SVN_Demo_Data_Modifier/blob/main/DDMLogo.png">
<p> The <b>ServiceNow Engineering Demo Data Modifier</b> was developed to facilitate the 
modification of demo data for presentation on the ServiceNow platform, which requires 
data uploads in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format. This application allows users to 
modify various data attributes such as the source, usage date, idle duration, and session 
duration. Additionally, it formats the data in the XML file in a more comprehensible manner, 
making it accessible to non-technical users. The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency 
of modifying demo data for users of all technical backgrounds </p>
